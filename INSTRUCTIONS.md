## Usage
QTBot can be used in two ways, direct communication for entertaining group discussion or the execution of commands

### Executing commands

If you want to use one of the many commands embeded with QTBot its fairly simple. Here is an example

Type the example in a group chat with QTBot

```
!xkcd 353
```

You'll get this as your output

```python
xkcd: Python
http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python.png
I wrote 20 short programs in Python yesterday.  It was wonderful.  Perl, I'm leaving you.
```
It's dead simple! During this phase of testing results may be a little delayed but for the most part instantnious

### Command List
Now that you know how to execute commands, lets give you a list and their syntax
```python
!slap [name]
!hug [name]
!users
!add x y
!multiply x y
!divide x y
!isup [website url]
!news
!md5 [string]
!sha512 [string]
!chat
!topic [topic]
!shrink [url]
!xkxd [example: 353]
!weather [city]
!chemical [example: water]
!uptime
!imdb [example: pulp fiction]
```
More commands and fuctions will be added as time goes by

**Be aware QTBot should be made MASTER or Host in the group to fuction fully**

### Having a conversation with QTBot

QTBot isn't just a command gateway, its an artifical intelligence. QTBot is built to learn about your indivual groups you invite it to and partake in conversation.

QTBot will respond to any phrases that contain "QT" or "QTBot" for the  sake of accurate learning try to make sure you only invoke these phrases when conversating.
