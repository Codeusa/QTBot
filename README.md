QTBot Bug Tracker
=====

This issue tracker is meant for community support and requests for improvements.

Reporting Issues
=====

If you encounter an issue while using QTBot, first search the issue list to see if it has already been reported. Include closed issues in your search. Some issues may have already been reported to other trackers, so it may be worth checking

If it has not been reported, create a new issue with at least the following information:

    a short, descriptive title;
    a detailed description of the issue, including any output from the command line;
    steps for reproducing the issue; and
    your system information.*
    
    
Conduct
=====

There are basic rules of conduct that should be followed at all times by everyone participating in the discussions. While this is generally a relaxed environment, please remember the following:

    Do not insult, harass, or demean anyone.
    Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.
    Do not use ALL CAPS when creating an issue report.
    Do not repeatedly update an open issue remarking that the issue persists.

Remember: Just because the issue you reported was reported here does not mean that it is an issue with QTBot. As well, should your issue not be resolved immediately, it does not mean that a resolution is not being researched or tested. Patience is always appreciated.
